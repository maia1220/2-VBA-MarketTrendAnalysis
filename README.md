# 2-VBA-Market Trend Analysis

## Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, I will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

## Analysis
* Use Excel VBA to evaluate the following for successful campaigns, and then for unsuccessful campaigns:

  * The mean number of backers.

  * The median number of backers.

  * The minimum number of backers.

  * The maximum number of backers.

  * The variance of the number of backers.

  * The standard deviation of the number of backers.

* Use data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.

* Use data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns.
