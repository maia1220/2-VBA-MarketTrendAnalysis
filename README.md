# 2-VBA-Stock Market Data Analysis

## Background

In this project I will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data for multiple years. 

## Analysis
* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.
  
  * Conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
